=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<txtnix> is a client for the decentralised, minimalist microblogging service
for hackers L<https://github.com/buckket/twtxt>.

Instead of signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform,
getting your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them in a
publicly accessible text file. The URL pointing to this file is your identity,
your account. twtxt then tracks these text files, like a feedreader, and builds
your unique timeline out of them, depending on which files you track. The
format is simple, human readable, and integrates well with UNIX command line
utilities.

All subcommand of I<txtnix> provides extensive help, so don't hesitate
to call them with the I<--help> option.

=head1 INSTALLATION

You can check L<INSTALL|https://github.com/mdom/txtnix/blob/master/INSTALL.pod>
to see all different ways to install txtnix but if want to use the fast and
easy way, the following commands will install txtnix and all dependencies to
~/perl5 and add lines to your bashrc to adjust some environment variables.

  $ curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - -l ~/perl5 App::cpanminus local::lib
  $ eval $(perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib=~/perl5)
  $ echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc
  $ cpanm https://github.com/mdom/txtnix.git

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

twtxt uses a simple INI-like configuration file. It checks
~/.config/txtnix/config for its configuration, but you can overwrite it
with the command line switch I<--config>.

Here's an example conf file, showing every currently supported option:

  [twtxt]
  nick = bob
  twtfile = ~/twtxt.txt
  twturl = http://example.org/twtxt.txt
  check_following = 0
  use_pager = 0
  use_cache = 1
  disclose_identity = 0
  limit_timeline = 20
  timeout = 5
  sorting = descending
  pre_tweet_hook  = "scp buckket@example.org:~/public_html/twtxt.txt {twtfile}"
  post_tweet_hook = "scp {twtfile} buckket@example.org:~/public_html/twtxt.txt"

  [following]
  alice = https://example.org/alice.txt
  charlie = https://example.org/charlie.txt

=head2 twtxt

=over 4

=item nick

Your nick, will be displayed in your timeline, expanded in your tweets
and send in your user agent string if you set I<disclose_identity>
to true. Defaults to your local username.

=item twtfile

Path to your local twtxt file. Defaults to I<~/twtxt.txt>.

=item twturl

URL to your public twtxt file. This is only needed in case you decide
to disclose your identity.

=item use_pager

Use a pager (less) to display your timeline. Defaults to false.

=item use_cache

Cache remote twtxt files locally. This defaults to true as their usually is no
reason not to do this. Every URL is checked with a I<If-Modified-Since>
header, so you still get always the most up-to-date timeline.

=item ca_file

Path to TLS certificate authority file used to verify the peer
certificate. Also activates hostname verification. Defaults to
I</etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt>. The file does not have to exist
to activate hostname verification. Setting this to an empty value
disables hostname verification on a global basis which is definitely
not recommended.

=item key_file

Path to TLS key file.

=item cert_file

Path to TLS cert file.

=item disclose_identity

Include nick and twturl in twtxt's user-agent. To respect your privacy this
feature is disabled by default. But you may enable it to let other users
discover that you follow them.

=item limit_timeline

Limit amount of tweets shown in your timeline. Defaults to 20.

=item timeout

Time a http request is allowed to take. Defaults to 5 seconds.

=item rewrite_urls

Rewrite urls you are following depending on their http response
code. Addresses that return 301 (moved permanently) are rewritten
to their new url. Return code 410 (gone) results in unfollowing that
address. Defaults to true. You get a warning if a url is rewritten.

=item embed_names

I<txtnix> expands the local names in your tweets to their urls. So I<@bob>
becomes I<@E<lt>http://example.com/twtxt.txtE<gt>>. With embed names you can
also share your local nickname with your followers. If this is set to true
mentions will be rewritten to I<@E<lt>bob http://example.com/twtxt.txtE<gt>>.
Defaults to true.

=item sorting

Order in which to sort the timeline. Can be either I<descending> or
I<ascending>. Defaults to I<descending>, so the newest tweets are on the top of
the timeline.

=item time_format

How to format dates in your timeline. This should be a strftime-like format
string. As special case you can set it to I<relative> to get relative dates
like I<1 hour and 23 minutes ago>. Defaults to I<%F %H:%M>.

=item pre_tweet_hook

Command to be executed before tweeting.

=item post_tweet_hook

Command to be executed after tweeting.

=item write_metadata

Write metadata about who you followed or unfollowed in your twtfile. The twtxt
file format does not specify any way to add metadata to your feed, so the
current implementation to use a text starting with I<//> is a properiaty
extension of txtnix. Use at your own risk. Defaults to false.

=item hide_metadata

Hide txtnix style metadata. Defaults to true.

=item use_colors

Use ANSI-colors for the I<pretty> layout. Defaults to true.

=item template

In which format to display your timeline. I<txtnix> defines two different
layout: I<simple> is a line oriented very basic layout. I<pretty> looks
less dense and supports ANSI colors and text wrapping. Defaults to I<pretty>.

=item wrap_text

If to wrap text in pretty display. Defaults to true.

=item character_limit

Number of characters a remote tweet can have. Setting it to zero will
disable this security precaution. Defaults to 1024.

=item expand_me

Expand I</me> at the start of a tweet's text to nickname. Defaults to false.

=back

=head2 followings

This section holds all your followings as nick, URL pairs. You can edit
this section manually or use the follow/unfollow commands of twtxt for
greater comfort.

=head2 colors

In I<pretty mode> mentions, hashtags, the nick and timestamp can be colorized
with ANSI colors. You can set either I<mention>, I<hashtag>, I<time> or
I<nick>:

  [colors]
  nick = blue on_magenta
  time = grey09
  hashtag = rgb515
  mention = clear

Setting a value to I<clear> will disable coloring for that element.

=head1 Plugins

Plugins can provide functions that are called when events happen in I<txtnix>. See
L<App::txtnix::Plugin> for a complete documentation how to write plugins.

Plugins need to be enabled in the configuration file to handle events:

  [MyPlugin]
  enabled = 1

I<txtnix> comes with three pre-installed plugins:

=over 4

=item * ShellExec

Works like the old hook system, but can run commands for all events:

  [ShellExec]
  pre_follow = echo Another follower

This plugin is always enabled as it implements the functionality of the
configuration options I<pre_tweet_hook> and I<post_tweet_hook>.

=item * GistStore

Uploads your twtfile to L<https://gist.github.com>. Needs your username and a
access token or your password (but really, please use a access token):

  [GistStore]
  enabled      = 1
  access_token = asdfasdfasdf
  user         = bob

=item * FTP

Uploads your twtfil to a ftp server. The only required parameter is the
hostname of the ftp server. You can supply a username and a password, both
defaults to values in I<~/.netrc>. If you do not give a remote file name, the
basename of your twtfile is used.

  [FTP]
  enabled     = 1
  user        = foo
  password    = bar
  remote_file = twtxt.txt

=item * LinkBack

Any time you mention somebody in your tweet and LinkBack is enabled, it checks
the mentioned users feed for a linkback command and posts your twturl as I<url>
parameter to that address. As there is currently no standard way to declare
metadata, it checks for a tweet with I<// linkback $url>.

  [LinkBack]
  enabled = 1

=back

=head1 Hooks

I<pre_tweet_hook> and I<post_tweet_hook> are very useful if you want to
push your twtxt file to a remote server. The following examples are just
some ideas, basically the sky is the limit.

Transmit the the latest tweet via curl to an http endpoint:

  post_tweet_hook = "tail -1 {twtfile} | curl -s -d @- -d 'name=foo' -d 'password=bar' http://example.com/feeds"

Publish your twtfile on aws s3:

  post_tweet_hook = "aws s3 cp {twtfile} s3://mybucket.org/twtxt.txt --cache-control 'max-age=60,public'"

Update your git hosted twtfile before tweeting and push it afterwards:

  pre_tweet_hook = "cd ~/git/website && git pull --rebase --prune"
  post_tweet_hook = "cd ~/git/website && git commit -m tweet twtxt.txt && git push"

=head1 Templates

If you're not happy with the included templates, I<txtnix>
will parse user-supplied templates. Simple copy a template under
I<$config_dir/templates/> (for example ~/.config/templates/myown.mt
on Linux) and call I<txtnix> with I<--template myown>. Templates are
written with L<Mojo::Template>, you can find an example in the source
package at I<templates/html.mt>.
